# Semantic_Find
Ctrl+F with semantic/similarity search on the current page.

Semantic Find is a Chrome extension that upgrades Ctrl+F with semantic, context-aware search on any webpage.

Finds conceptually similar text, not just exact keyword matches.

Works in two modes: semantic and classic exact search.

Indexes the page by logical blocks (paragraphs, code, headings) for cleaner matches.

Lets you filter by type: All, Text, Code, or Headings.

Highlights the best-matching block and scrolls it into view.

Provides a side list of top matches with previews.

Includes Next/Prev navigation with a live counter (e.g., 3/12).

Uses local scoring (no external API by default) and can be extended with embeddings later.
